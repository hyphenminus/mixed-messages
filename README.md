# Random weather message

## Mixed Messages project for Codecademy

This demonstration project takes no input but outputs a fictitious weather forecast for today, tomorrow and the weekend.

The text is output to the JavaScript console log from the command line or to a webpage.

The forecast for each day has random wording for the type of precipitation, temperature description, wind strength and wind source.

## Technologies

 * JavaScript (ES6+, using `"use strict";` and arrow function expressions)
 * Node (v14.17.5)

## Usage

* As a webpage:
  * Copy the `random-weather.html` and `script.js` files to the same folder and open the HTML page in a browser.
  * Or view the webpage [online](https://hyphenminus.github.io/mixed-messages/random-weather.html)
* As text from the command line:
  * `node script.js`
